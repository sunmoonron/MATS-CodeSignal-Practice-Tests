# MATS CodeSignal Practice Tests
Toy models to implement with verifiable unit-tests generated by ChatGPT-5.2 Pro. Each task should take up to 90 minutes to implement (may take more if unfamiliar with the Standard Python Library being tested).

**Note:** Implementations are not provided—use the specifications and unit tests to build and validate your solutions.
